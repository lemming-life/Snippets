/* Challenge2 Description:

Write a program that, given an integer, sums all the numbers from 1 through that integer (both inclusive). Do not include in your sum any of the intermediate numbers (1 and n inclusive) that are divisible by 5 or 7.
Input:

Your program should read lines from standard input. Each line contains a positive integer.
Output:

For each line of input, print to standard output the sum of the numbers from 1 through n, disregarding those divisible by 5 and 7. Print out each result on a new line.
